# ScienceStories Interface

### Objective
This website has been developed to use the recordings obtained from the ScienceStories_Gameified Android Wear app to teach science in class.

### Implementation
The website was developed using HTML5, JavaScript and mostly PHP. I used MySQL as the database because it interacts well with PHP commands.
The main functionality of the website is the lesson planner which is shown as a calendar and allows the user to create lessons along with descriptions and also provides the functionality to add relevant stories recorded by the students.
