"1","I found one of my scientific research when Luke was sliding on the maroon leather couch it was friction but he glided very easily so i figured the leather couch must have been smooth even though he was a little rough so it must have been an inbetween friction. Not a lot but not really a little"
"2","Another friction that I found out about Troy was writing with a pencil on paper. The pencil was rough but the paper was smooth I figured it must've been an in between friction too."
"3","Today on Thursday we are running outside for PE and i noticed that we are running and it was friction because everyone's shoes were on the sidewalk and it must've been a lot of friction because the sidewalk surfaces were rough and our shoes were rough"
"4","My fourth friction story is when i was sliding on the wood floor with my socks. The socks were smooth and the wood was nice and smooth and there must have been less friction which is why I was gliding very easily"
"5","My fifth and last scientific seeing about friction my scientific story is when i picked up a stuffed animal from the coffee table and before i could pick it up it slid across. It's fur was very soft and smooth and the coffee was very smooth and i figured there must have not been very much friction"
"6","My first story on my science for the research is magnetism. I have a magnet on a board and it sticks so it is magnetism."
"7","My second story on science is when my baby cousin bounced a red ball. It was gravity i could tell because it bounced up and then came down to the ground so it was pulling."
"8","My third story is when Luke was sliding across the floor in his socks since it was very quickly since the socks and the floor was pretty smooth there wasn't much friction"
"9","My fourth voice memo on science is when someone was rolling a ball in PE across the floor, that was friction."
"10","My fifth and final story for this science experiment was when i saw someone accidentally drop their paper off their desk it floated to the ground. If there wasn't any gravity it would have stayed up but since the pull of force of gravity pulled it down that was gravity and it came down."
"11","Okay so as we're driving home in the car i'm seeing all these brake lights come on and i'm realizing that the cars are using friciton and they are having to brake or stop and they are having to use friction to stop because the wheels have to rub with the road to slow down or stop at the red lights or the stop signs. Even when they're driving friction is still in action trying to get the car to stop."
"12","For my first story as we're sitting here playing Mario Cart 8 we're having to use science because we're having to figure out the best combinations of speed, acceleration, handling traction and weight to be the best or just what we like in a race."
"13","As I'm looking out my window I'm seeing that some of the leaves on the trees are falling because of gravity because gravity is pulling htem towards the earth so leaves are falling down and this is science because gravity is one of the forces of science and when it's falling that's gravity in action."
"14","While I'm sitting on the couch im noticing my mom's water bottle and it's been sitting out for a while and I'm noticing the condensation on the water bottle because the water has been like evaporating and has been not evaporating condensing on the outside of the water bottle."
"15","Okay so as I'm turning on the lights i'm noticing science becuase when you flip the switch it makes an electrical circuit complete so and the circuit goes to the light so and it turns the lights on."
"16","As I'm playing with my remote control car the remote has to send some sort of frequency to the car and it's science because you have to use all of that technology to make that frequency to the car."
"17","As i'm listening to the radio in the car it's using science because it has to protect sound waves that reach your ears that allows us to hear the radio and whatever is playing on the radio whether it's a song or somebody talking or anything."
"18","I rolled my toy car across the room and friction slowed it down and it eventually came to a stop. I know it was friction or else the toy car would have kept going and going and going"
"19","When i kick my ball in the tall grass of our backyard it did not go very far because there was too much friction. But when i kicked the ball in the short grass of the soccerfields it went farther since it has the right amount of friction."
"20","When I'm cold i rub my hands together which creates friction which creates energy which warms up my hands"
"21","When i need to move something from one place to another..how could i do it? Well first i could use a piece of wood, put it on there and start dragging it, but that would not work very well because too much friction. But if i use a sled it would be better but still too much friction. Finally my last option is a wagon which is the greatest one to use because it has wheels which will create the right amount of friction."
"22","So when i shuffle my feet across the carpet in our livingroom it creates friction which creates energy that needs to be released. So whenever I touch something after I've shuffled my feet across the carpet, I shock it."
"23","Gravity is the force that pulls you back down so if you jumped up and down you would go up and then come back down on earth. But if you were on a planet for instance the moon you would if you jumped it would take you longer to come back down since there is less gravity. But another planet would have more gravity and when you would jump up it would pull you down faster. That is one example of gravity."
"24","When you go outside and look up and think hey look at the tree i wonder how it survives? Well if you look up and you notice that it has leaves the leaves collect sun and moisture and it creates food for the tree and that is how it survives that is called photosynthesis it is very cool to learn about."
"25","When you're outside you notice that some trees have needles and some trees have leaves. Well the trees that have leaves lose them in the winter but the trees that have needles sometimes they stay all winter. Well the reason is that the leaves are wider and have more surface area to freeze so that's why they freeze and fall off. But pine needles are smaller they have a smaller surface area and they don't need as much food and they're usually waxy covered they're wax covered so that's why pine needles stay on the tree and leaves don't."
"26","If you put on a black shirt when there is not very much sunlight you will get warmer faster because black absorbs more sun. The reason is because black is darker and it absorbs more sunlight because the sunlight wants to make it lighter so that's how it works. But if you were wearing a white tshirt on a cold day well then you would get colder because there is not as much sunlight absorbing it because it is light already."
"27","When a volcano errupts lava comes out and steam but after the volcano errupts the lava starts to go down the side of the mountain. Once it reaches the ground it starts to cool off so after it cools off enough it turns into rock and some volcanic rocks have holes in them because that's how it dried."
"28","The carpet is rougher than the tile at my house that is because there is more friction on the carpet than on the tile."
"29","When i pivoted on the basketball court i did not slide because i had friction on my shoes."
"30","I slipped and fell on the tile because my socks had no friction"
"31","My sister plays the cello and when she slides her bow across the strings she produces friction. That friction creates music."
"32","When my dog rides in the front seat of the car and my mom slams on the brakes his paws have little friction so he flies straight into the window. Poor Shadow."
"33","From rubbing the balloon on my hair makes static electricity from the friction"
"34","Rubbing a match against the match box makes a light"
"35","Lights are powered by electricity"
"36","Elevators are connected by electricity."
"37","Cars are moted by motors."
"38","Tv is powered by electricity."
"39","Okay so, i slid on the couch and jumped on the couch which makes it friction because i was running on the couch too. I was moving on the couch making big noises."
"40","So, I was sliding and jumping on the couch which makes it friction. It was also moving and squishing on the couch which was making big noises."
"41","Today i was sliding my legos together which makes it friction because i was sliding two things together"
"42","I was sliding my finger on my kindle which makes it friction because i was sliding the finger on the kindle"
"43","I heard the car rolling around the pavement which counts as friction"
"44","I saw a bike that was riding around the pavement which counts as friction."
"45","My baby cousin was bouncing the ball which makes it a matter of gracity because it was pushing the ball down."
"46","Is saw the flag blowing throught the sky which makes it motion."
"47","I saw a car moving down the road which makes it friction"
"48","I saw people jump at recess which makes it gravity."
"49","Have you ever road a sled down a snowy hill at a rapid speed? At the bottom of the hill you suddenly hit a bare sidewalk with no snow on it. What happened? Gravity helped pull you down hill, what made you stop? Another force was at work to stop you, friction makes things stop. Friction is the name of the force that is present when two things rub against each other. The sled runners in the snow were smooth so very little friction slowed your sled down hill. The side walk was rough so more friction resulted. Without friction you would have a hard time moving about without sliding. You cannot go anywhere on a car or on a bicycle because the wheels would spin around in one spot. Friction helps you by pushing against wheels to make them turn. Even the air pushing against you causes friction. Airplanes are streamlined to lessen friction. Friction, like gravity can be of help to you."
"50","Friction is a dragging force that happens when things rub against each other it can cause some painful injuries like when you scrape your knees or get a massive blister from your shoe or burn your hands sliding down a rope, OUCH. If it weren't for friction everyday would be like walking down ice. Friction happens when two surfaces are in contact and are trying to move passed each other, they catch and rub and slow each other down. This can manage them and it also uses up energy. Rough or squishy surfaces like sand paper and rubber have more friction. Smooth shiny surfaces like glass have less. When friction happens some of the move and energy gets turned into heat and the surfaces warm up, that's why your hands warm up when you rub them together on a cold day. Heat from friction is used to strike matches and also lets you start a fire by rubbing sticks together"
"51","Friction, UH OH! While a used dessert surfer [?] is missing more than a steering wheel it has no brakes! Fortunately the force of friction seems to be slowing it down. Friction is a force that counteracts motion. Friction slows objects down as they rub up against one another. As the wheels of the surfer rubs against the ground the force slows their rotation and the surfers speed but the amount of friction between the wheels and the ground is small. The speed is only reduced a little. However Whilly can create more friction by leaning back to drag the surfers back and on the ground. When there is a lot of friction moving objects slow down quickly."
"52","If you are riding your bike and you begin going down a hill the force of gravity will make you pick up speed. Have you ever thought about how a bike's brakes help you slow down or stop? That's friction at work. Friction is when one object rubs against another object. This action slows an objecys movement. If you look at a bike's brake you will see that they are little rubber pads on either side of the tire. When you use the brakes these pads apply friction to the tire, slowing the speed at which the wheels are moving."
"53","Sometimes you can see what is pushing or pulling and sometimes you can't.If you roll your toy car and it hits the wall or the couch you can see that the wall or the couch stops the car, the wall or the couch produce force that stops, if the car hits your big brother you better run! If the car doesn't hit a wall, or your big brotherr, or the couch, or the cat or anything you can see it still stops. What is pushing on the car to make it stop? A force called friction! Everything is bumpy, even things that feels smooth like glass or ice are still bumpy. You can't feel the bumps on glass because they are too small and you can't see them either but they are still there. Whenever two things rub against each other the bumps on those things rubs against each other. The force of the bumps rubbing against each other is called friction. Friction makes moving things slow down. When you roll your car the bumps on the floor push against the bumps on the car wheels a little bit, this friction is the force that stops the car."
"54","My first story is about marble, it's a kind of rock. It says marble occurs in a variety of colors depending on the purity of the original limestone. If the limestone is pure the marble is white. If there are impurities the marble can be black, green, red or yellow/brown. If the impurities were spread out unevenly the marble was spotty or marbleed. Because a marble is soft but sturdy it has been a popular building in carving stone through the ages. Unfortunately, like limestone, marble slowly disintegrates in acid rain."
"55","My second story is about water. Water is a liquid that is made up of two ingredients, hydrogen and oxygen. This special liquid has no color and no taste and no smell. Water takes the shape of whatever container it is placed in. There are three different forms of water: liquid, solid and gas. LIquid water fills our rivers and oceans, it comes out of a water fountain or faucet. It can be splashed or sprayed. When liquid water gets very cold  it freezes, frozen water becomes hard and solid we call it ice. Ice is not as heavy as liquid water but it has a shape and takes up space. Sometimes water evaporates, it dries up and turns to gas. This gas called water vapor rises into the air most of the time water vapor is invisible. It can only be seen when the temperature is very hot or very cold. Hot water vapor forms in the low clouds of steam you can see steam rising from water that is boiling on the stove. Cold water vapor appears like Mr. Fog, the clouds in the sky are made of cold water vapor. When you breathe outside on a cold day the water vapor in your breath may look like a little cloud. Water is the only substance on earth that can be found naturally in the three different forms, it can be a liquid, a solid or a gas."
"56","My third story is about the Triceratops, most common large plant eating dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous period in western North America where the Triceratops, they were found Nowhere else in the world. The word which means horned faced fits with these massive four leg dinosaurs. They had huge heads and a boney frail developed from the rear skull bones that protected their neck. Different species had from one to a dozen sharp horns growing from their snout, head or from the boney frail. The pillarlike legs and heaving hooved feet supported a stocky body that was covered with a tough thick hide. Scientists now believe that these dinosaurs could run up to speeds at least 30 mph at least for a short distance. The modern animal they resemeble most is the rhinosaurus but the dinosaurs were much bigger. A charging dinosaur of this type would have been a terrifying foe and that time dinosaurs need all the protection they could get, the Cretaceous one was a dangerous one. All the evidence suggests that these dinosaurs found safety in numbers. They moved in great herds through the forests and when threatened by some of the great predators of the period like Tyrannosaurus they could have formed a cirlce with their horned heads facing outwards towards the danger, The smaller and weaker young would be in the center, that would have been an effective defense even against the fearsome Tyrannosaurus. These dinosaurs did not have teeth, they forged throught the upland forests chopping off vegetation with their shape toothless beaklike mouthsthey adapted to take advantage of the newly evolved and tougher vegetation of the late Cretaceous. Of all the horned dinosaurs the best known and probably the most numerous was Triceratops. It was probably the largest dinosaur of this type a full grown Triceratops weighed more than the modern African bull elephant today's largest land animal. It's skull alone with the short neck frail has more than 6 feet long. It had a short thick nose horn and two long horns higher on it's head. These horns could have measured more than three feet each. Scientists were confused when the first fragamentary remains of this create were discovered. When the great fossil collecter Marsh was shown the horns of a Triceratops he thought they belonged to an extinct species of bufallo. Marsh was wrong, a few years later one of his associates found a full skull of one of the creatures. Marsh realized that the horns came from a long extinct dinosaur not a dead buffallo. Because of the massive structure of  Triceratops skull it was more likely to be preserved than the bones of other weaker dinosaurs. Hundreds of well preserved Triceratops specimens have been found over the years in the Western US and Canada. The American fossil hunter Barnum Brown is said to have collected more than 500 skulls of this particular dinosaur. Today more than 15 species of Triceratops were recognized. Fossilized remains of this dinosaur can be found in most large and many small museum collections. Many of the skulls, horns and neck frames were found to be damaged and scared. This suggests that this individual and often Triceratops often sparred with one another. Perhaps they locked horns and shoved one another with their head shields rather than doing actual damage with their shapr horns. These dangerous weapons were probably only used on real enemies like Tryannosaurus. Fossils show that Tricerotops continued to flourish right up to the end of Creteceous period. It may well have been the last surviving large dinosaur in the Western part of North America and perhaps the last surviving large dinosaur in the entire world but it too mysteriously died off at the end of the Cretaceous period along with all the other dinosaurs."
"57","My fourth story is about seals. Seals rely on their sense to find and track prey and avoid threats. In general they have good vision and hearing. Seals can usually see well in both light and dark conditions, whether they are on the sunny beach or the dark depths of the ocean. A seals hearing is about as good as a human's when it is on land however this sense becomes much stronger under water. Some seals have a range of hearing more than three times greater than humans have under water. Seals also rely heavily on their sense of touch when they are under water. The long whiskers on a seals face are very sensitive they can feel even the smallest movements in the water. As fish an other sea animals swim they leave behind trails of movement in the water, a seals whiskers can detect these trails from animals that passed by from more than a half a minute or later. This allows the seal to track prey and avoid preditors. "
"58","My last story is about they Beagle, they come from Great Britain. Beagles were originally bread to hunt rabbit in packs in Great Britain. They first came to the US in the 19th century now they are one of America's most popular pet dogs. The bread is at least 150 years old. Beagles are small dogs. They have big brown eyes and long droopy ears, their tails are medium length, they have short coats that are tan, black and white. There are two sizes of Beagles, height up to 13 inches or 13-15 inches. Weight 20-30 pounds. Personality: Beagles are friendly and bubbly. They get along with everyone, they love kids and dogs. They are very playful and they love to dig. Activity level: moderate. First loves: more people, running and chasing, digging. Best Families: Beagles love kids with  time to hang out, they don't mind living in the city or the country. Pluses: easy to groom, friendly, good watch dogs, good with kids and other dogs. Minuses: bark, can be stubborn, dig, will wonder. Fun fact: the US department of Homeland Security uses Beagles to search for illegal plants, fruit and meat coming into the country. These detection Beagles are called the Beagle Brigade. The Beagle Brigade is made up mostly of Beagles rescued from shelters."

"61","Friction let my pencil stop rolling."
"62","The ball stopped."
"63","Friction let the car drive."
"64","The batteries turned on the XBox controller"
"65","Science let me eat my food because it helped me digest it."
"66","Gas extracted from the ground or oil let us let our car drive."
"67","So what i did was i had my skateboard and i pushed with myself on it, not very fast but it took 9 seconds to go to a full stop. And then i pushed it without me on it and it took ten seconds to stop"
"68","So this time i poured water on the concrete and it kept going and it almost reached the edge of the concrete. It got a little bit more than half way until it stopped, i really did think it would get to the end,"
"69","So i was shooting my bow and arrow and the friction in the air made my bow and arrow go slower. Some went pretty far but it would have gone faster if there weren't any friction in the air."
"70","So i was rubbing my hands together because i was cold and they became really hot because of friction."
"71","So i had an egg on the counter and it started rolling and then it stopped because of friction"
"72","I was riding on my bicyle and i just pumped it a few times and then i waited and it went to a full stop because of friction"
"73","I'm afraid to go outside because there's birds outside and when they poop gravity pulls it to the earth"
"74","I tripped and was pulled to the earth by gravity"
"75","An egg rolled off of the counter and it fell because of gravity"
"76","So i was on the trampoline and i went up and gravity forced me down"
"77","When my pet hampster rolls in his ball there is no friction pushing it back so he goes on forever until he hits a wall."
"78","When the marbles i dropped were rolling the friction wasn't pushing it back because it was a circular object so it would not roll backwards, it wouldn't be pushed back."
"79","When my brother was dribbling the basketball there was no friction in the air so the ball wouldn't stop in the air so it would go down and up and wouldn't stop."
"80","The friction of me writing with my pencil since the paper was a solid surface it would not move back."
"81","When i was walking and running there was no friction stopping me from doing either of those."
"82","When i dropped my pencil there was no gravity uh there was gravity pushing it to the floor."
"83","When i dropped my football there was gravity pushing it down"
"84","When leaves were floating down there was low gravity pushing it down"
"85","The weather in the moring, uh the skies always dark so there's so the weathers's cooler and when the sun comes up the weather gets warmer"
"86","When i was running and walking there was momentum from keeping me from stopping"
"87","Hello my name is Isabel and i'm going to be telling you a little bit about gravity. Gravity is what holds you to the ground or what keeps you to the floor. Today what i noticed was that in recess everyone was playing and the balls were dropping, everyone was running and having fun but without even floating they kept dropping and staying on the floor. So I was being kind of observant and asking people if they know what gravity is I got a lot of different answers and a lot of different friends that i could ask. So that's what i did today"
"88","Today when i got home i figured out that things weren't floating when i thought they might be but that would only be crazy. And so when i went in my room and instead of everything floating everything was staying where they were especially the things that are big. Even the things that are real weren't moving. Only things that i was holding. So that is what i was observing today, my name is Isabel and this was about gravity bye!"
"89","On Saturday uh my mom was cooking and the way that she was cooking our dinner, she was kind of making smoke and i didn't really like how it smelled. So i tried to go to my room and i had socks on and i slipped and instead of floating i absolutely fell to the ground and hurt my left ear. So what i did was i put some cold onion and when my mom opened the freezer door nothing really floated. And we were watching a Pokemon movie and there was a Pokemon floating and they were supposed to do that. So that was my story about Saturday and I actually made it today. Well my name is Isabel and i just wanted to tell you a little bit about my day saturday. "
"90","Yesterday i was doing yoga and the person that was on the DVD kept mentioning that gravity helps you do yoga"
"91","Today when i was in kids club and we have something called club and i'm in a science club and we were doing this thing where there was an experiment about trying to make fake blood out of corn starch and corn syrup, red dye, and blue dye "
"92","Today I watched my mom drive the car down the pavement and when she wanted to stop she had to push the brakes down to put more friction on the wheels to stop the vehicle from running."
"93","I tested out my friction experiment with my soccer ball in the tall grass of my backyard and the ball..there was too much friction so the soccer ball didn't go that fast it went super slow in the grass, in the tall grass in my backyard. Then i tried it on my trampoline and it went too fast."
"94","I learned that when you're trying to lift something over a tree branch with a rope the device that you need to pull it is a pully so that the friction won't be as hard because if the friction is too hard the tree branch will eventually break so what you need is a pully so that there is less friction."
"95","If you have a pile of bricks and you're trying to move them from one place to another and you put a piece of wood on the ground and put the bricks on top of that piece of wood and you start to pull or push the wood it wouldn't work because there is too much friction touching the ground from the wood to the ground so what you need is some wheels to put it on there so there is less friction and then you can pull it easier because of the wheels."
"96","If you have a gun and you're trying to cock it and you get it back and it's not running well and it *makes scraping noise* what you need to fix that is oil so there is less friction so you can just *clicking noise* and then it will be ready."
"97","If you have gears and they're not running so good if they're not turning right and they won't work, what you do is you get oil and you put it in there so there is less friction so they'll run better but if you don't have oil then there is too much friction and they won't run."
"98","I learned that if you have a ball and if you drop that ball it will fall and bounce because of gravity and if there wasn't any gravity it would fall, it wouldn't fall"
"99","When you're on earth you weigh the same as you always weigh but if  you're on the moon or a different or another planet then you will weigh lighter. and some planets you weigh heavier but the moon it's so light that there's not much gravity so you can hop a lot easier and jump and your walking is not usual."
"100","When you're on a trampoline and you bounce up and when you're coming back down that gravity. And how i know it's gravity is that if there wasn't any gravity then you wouldn't bounce you would float"
"101","If you have a pulley and you are trying to lift something up that's crazy heavy all you need to do is have something heavier than the thing that you are trying to pull up. And once you like your strength so what you do is you pull one end of the rope and what you what it'll do is it'll lift up the other end."
"102","If you have a bolder and you're trying to move it what you do is you get a long hard thick stick and you put one of those ends of the stick under the rock and you push down on the end that's not under the rock and it'll act like a lever and it'll push the rock up and kinda like a seasaw so one end goes down and the other end goes up"
"103","My pencil falls off my desk, my papers fall off my desk, my notebook falls off my desk, my eraser falls off my desk, my glue falls off my desk. Everything falls off my desk!"
"104","The bird just did a dive thanks to gravity"
"105","The library is has a bridge across to it and is being held up by both the library and the walkway across from the other side of it"
"106","The bridge across to the library is being held up by both the library and the building across form it that is part of gravity because it makes us not fall off "
"107","Leaves are falling to the ground"
"108","I was pretending that i flicked down some bikes and then later while i was on my way here i found a bike that fell down"
"109","A sled is going down a snowy hill, that is a example of friction"
"110","A piece of paper just went off the table, it is slowly going down to the ground, that is an example of gravity"
"111","I realized that friction causes cars to stop when you step on the brakes the brake pannel goes on the tire to stop the tire."
"112","So i was going to school and i saw these kids riding their bike and i noticed that hte concrete was a little bit smoother so that allows them to go riding on their bike."
"113","I noticed that when i slid on the carpet i stopped almost immediately because the carpet is a rough surface so me sliding against it causes me to stop."
"114","Okay so i just got in the truck and i started rubbing my hands together because it's cold outside so i started rubbing my hands together and i i noticed that they started to warm up a little bit and it was it was friction because friction causes heat also."
"115","So today i see a skateboarder near aggieland and he's grinding on a rail and i saw sparks come out from under his board and i realized that it was friction and like i said earlier friction causes heat so i just saw an example of friction."
"116","Today I was driving to school and I saw this fountain and I realized it was science because it's pushing up against gravity so that hose has to be really strong"
"117","Okay again I'm still going to my school and I see this house and it has this big blue like sheet around insilating the house so it keeps it warm in the winter and keeps heat out in the summer"
"118","So I was at the school and I noticed that we were doing ukelelees in music and i saw this poster on the wall and it had something producing sound and it had sound waves like expanding out from that um instrument or sound machine"
"119","So while on the way to drop this watch off and we stopped to get gas and I realized that gas is made up of a bunch of different chemicals and it fuels the car obviously. So i just thought that was really cool and it popped out to me and i just thought it was really interesting."
"120","So i see cars all around me and i realize that cars are science because they use, there's all these pistons and [something] to it and these..it has an engine and it's just really cool how cars work."
"121","Friction is something that makes things slow down without friction we would be sliding around everywhere. Friction is either a lot or less and it depends on the texture if it's nice and smooth there will be less friction if it is a hard rough ground it will be more friction. For an example if you were ice skating ice is very less friction so you will be mostly sliding around everywhere."
"122","Another example of friction is if um you have a pencil and a desk is slightly tilted there is still there will be very less friction and the pencil will automatically start rolling."
"123","Try putting on socks and then try sliding everywhere it's pretty easy oh and try doing it on a smooth surface and when you do it it's pretty easy isn't it? Because the bottom of your socks are smooth and that means there's less friction which means you slide. But try it with shoes it isn't that easy because shoes have a rough bottom and that means more friction and that also means you won't move as well."
"124","Try kicking a soccer ball on a smooth surface, it's pretty easy because you're doing it on a smooth surface which means less friction and less friction means it'll go pretty easily and far. But then try doing it on a carpet, it's not gonna work as well because it's pretty rough well that is because the friction is more and that means it'll slow down and go not as far."
"125","Try sliding a ball down a slide, it'll go pretty easily because there's less friction which means that it'll go easily. now try doing it on a rough slide, that means it won't go easily because more friction always means that it'll go a lot slower."
"126","To make a crystal you have to tie strings to make a design, dip it in water in hot water with borax and then leave it over night. When it is morning it will have dissolved and it would have turned into a crystal."

"130","Okay so this is going to be about gravity, number one. So if you have a hair cut then your hair will feel then your head will feel lighter than it is with longer so the longer your hair is the heavier your head will feel so if you get your hair cut gravity will change the feeling in on your head and it will feel a little less than it is so gravity is what changes so if you get your hair cut the shorter it is the less pounds the less it's less heavier so the longer it is the heavier your head will feel so that's for the first one"
"131","When i was at the park i was testing out if the bigger rock was going to go down on the ground faster than the little rock but instead it looked like they fell on the ground at the same time and that's it for this story"
"132","When i was playing with two balls one was bouncy and one was a soccer ball and when i dropped them at the same time the bouncy ball bounced higher than the soccer ball i think it's because that we did that because it was that gravity there was less gravity in the bouncy ball and the soccer ball had more gravity so that's why i think the bouncy ball bounces higher than the other"
"133","Um I was thinking if we had no gravity at all we would be flying into outerspace by now but if we had just a little less we might be able to just jump really high and maybe float a little bit and also our water might not spill very well or anything so i think that would be cool"
"134","So i was thinking i hope there's a machine that i can go in so i can fly around and the water won't spill and i can drink it from a straw and that's all"
"135","When you rub your hands together and they get warm that's an example of friction"
"136","Polution makes the environment unhealthy. Air polution can happen if a car gives out too much carbon dioxide if trees are there it can take it in and nothing will go wrong but if the trees are cut down and used to make buildings then the polution will spread and it can effectthe environment and the human life and health."

"144","I poured water into a glass and it didn't float away"
"145","I threw a rock and it went to the ground"
"146","I threw a rock into the water and it slowed down because the mass in the water is greater"

"156","One time i saw a bird go to the bathroom on my dad's car and when he went to the bathroom in the air i noticed that the bird droppings went down and that was gravity"
"157","Over the weekend I went riding my bike and I was riding it and concrete was friction. Friction the the wheels and my bike."
"158","Gravity pulls you up from space and um without gravity everything would fall down and uh and there's more gravity in the moon better than the earth and uh and in space there's lots of gravities and i talked about four topics or five about different about gravity as i can remember. One more, gravity is all over space and and and planets and and without the gravity every planet will fall down and *inaudible*"
"159","Do you know why water when your mom boils water in your house do you know why there's bubbles? It's because [to mom ""what is it mom""] it's because the water's evaporation up to the clouds that's making clouds"
"160","I am going to tell you about condensation and preciptiation. Do you know why the cloud gets darker and darker it's because more water is coming in and that means it's condensation and when the water's getting up from the cloud and it gets darker that means that it's precipitation and it's tons of fun when you have rain"
"161","I am going to talk about planets. Planets are things that have different creatures and different things that can be poison, dangerous, there's tons of creatures there like maybe humans, aliens something but there might be different stuff that we never seen in planets but we will seen but we will see later"
"162","Do you know why rocks do you know where rocks come from? rocks come from glaciers, mountains um and do you know how it forms a rock? It's because the weather, years come on, weather comes on everything breaks and it comes to rock and that's why you can find rock anywhere you go."
